### long-life assets

indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized,but they are reported on B/S unless impaired

initial cost has nothing to do  with the useful life of an intangible assets

net income in revalution method should not exceed the origin price

An assets is impaired when the firm cant recover the carring value

Gain or loss is equal to the sale proceeds minus the carrying value,where carrying value is the cost minus accumulated depreciation

In the year after an impairment or reduction charge ,the amortization(or depreciation) will be lower, increasing net income

The remaining useful life can be estimated as ending net PP&E(origin cost - accumulative cost) divided by annual depreciation
