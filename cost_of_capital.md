### cost of capital

increase in the corporate tax rate will decrease WACC;
if the risk-free rate increase,the cost of debt and equity would both increase,thus causing the firm's cost of capital to increase;

break point = amount of capital the component's cost of capital changes / weighted of the component in the WACC;

the project beta calculated using the pure-play method is not necessarily related in a predictable way to the beta of the firm that is performing the project.
