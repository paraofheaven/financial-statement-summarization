EPS:Earning per 
simple capital structure:
no potentially dilutive securities
only common stock,nonconvertible debt,nonconvertible perferred stock
complex capital struture:
potencially dilutive securities
basic EPS: (net income -perferred dividends)/weighted average number of common shares outstanding
  where weighted average = (nums of shares * weighted years left)/12 ,july 1 is 1/2,May 1 is 8/12 (12-5+1)/12(in exam, inbythe days in fact)
reacquired shares are excluded in computation
the diluted EPS equation:
	diluted EPS = (net income - preferred divs） + （convertible preferred divs） + （convertible debt interest) × （1-t）/
	weighted + conv.pfd.share + conv.debt + stock option

gross profit margin  = gross profit / revenue
net profit margin = net profit / revenue

when a company has potentially dilutive securities,it must report diluted EPS.
