#### Fixed income Securities

Dual-currency bonds pay coupon interest in one currency and principal in a different currency.

Tax authorities typically treat the increase in value of a pure-discount bond toward par as interest income to the bondholder.

The price of a currently callable bond should never rise above its call price.
