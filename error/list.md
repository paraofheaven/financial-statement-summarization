MAD = |Xi-X| / n

NPV = CFt / (1+r)^t
	perpetuity is CF/r

NPV and IRR conflict when 
	1)scale of investments may differ
	2)timing of cash flow may differ

Multi IRR not in conventional cash flow

mutually exclusive mean can't accept both projects.

compound rate of return = geometric mean - 1

sharpe ratio = (Rp - Rf)/sp   sp is the standard deviation

p-value smaller, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis,minimize is the zero.

Neckline - (Head - Neckline) = Price target.

multivariate normal distribution is defined by n means, n variances, and n × (n − 1)/2 distinct correlations.

confidence interval = Point estimate ± Reliability factor × Standard error. 

The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator and provides information on whether or not an asset is overbought or oversold. An RSI greater than 70 indicates that a stock is overbought; an RSI lower than 30 suggests that a stock is oversold.

The Mann–Whitney U-test is most appropriate for tests of differences in means for nonparametric data such as analysts’ rankings.
Wilcoxon signed-rank test is most appropriate for testing the significance of a single mean or mean differences (paired comparisons test) for nonparametric data
a sign test is most appropriate for testing mean differences (paired comparisons test) in nonparametric data.

EAR = (1 + r)^ m - 1   r = annual interest rate / nums

EAR = e^名义利率 - 1

HPY = (P1 - P0 + CF1) / P0

rMM = HPY ✖️ （360 / t）

	和银行贴现收益率相似：rBD = (F - P0)/F ✖️ (360 / t)

EAY = (1 + HPY)^(365/t) - 1

	EAY = (1 + BEY/2)^2 - 1 

时间加权收益率 = [(1 + HPR1)(1 + HPR2)(1 + HPR3)]^(1/3) -1
货币加权收益率 = CF0 + [CF1/(1+IRR)] + [CF2/(1+IRR)^2] + [CF3/(1+IRR)^3)
